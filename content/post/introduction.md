I have read the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs nearly 20 years ago and this is still remember it vividly. Going through this book was intense and enlightening. It had a deep impact on how I would think about programming.

After 20 years, my work has moved me farther and farther from software engineering: managing teams, managing products, doing consulting works, etc. In the last few years, I had the opportunity to see complex software being built, and I was disappointed at the lack of quality and the level of bugs in the code base.

Many seems to think that building high quality software takes more time and can't be afforded. I refuse to believe that. My belief is that high quality software can be built not only faster, but cheaper than crappy software in the long run.

Bu at some point, you have to stop arguing about it and show the money. Well, this is my starting point. I plan to read the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs again, this time doing all the exercise. This is a warmup before attacking more ambitious things.

I expect that by doing that I will:

- become a better software engineer
- aquire a deeper understanding of functional programming
- have fun programming and building things

This is the current plan:

- Read the book
- Watch the video from the 1986 session
- Write a short summary of each chapter and subchapter
- Complete all the 356 exercises by myself, and publish my solution here
- Review my solution and compare them to http://community.schemewiki.org/?SICP-Solutions or other solutions

We will see how it goes
